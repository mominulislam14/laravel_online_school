          <p>Online school, also known as virtual school, is an educational platform that allows students to learn remotely using the internet. Online schools can offer a wide range of courses and educational resources, making it easier for students to pursue their academic interests and career goals. One of the biggest advantages of online school is its flexibility, which allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. However, online learning can also present some challenges, such as the lack of social interaction and hands-on learning experiences that are available in traditional classrooms.</p>  
          <p>Overall, online school can be a great option for students who value independence and flexibility in their learning, but it's important to carefully consider the pros and cons before enrolling in an online program.</p>
